### Indirect Statement

The subject of the clause in indirect speech is in the *accusative*, and it must not be left out. The verb is in the *infinitive* and is *in the tense of the words actually spoken or thought*. The infinitive exists in three tenses: present, future, perfect.

- Active:

    > **dīxī *mē* librum *legere*.**  
    > I said I was reading the book.

    > **dīxī *mē* librum *lēctūrum esse*.**  
    > I said that I would read the book.

    > **dīxī *mē* librum *lēgisse*.**  
    > I said I had read the book.

- Passive:

    > **dīxī librum ā *mē legī*.**  
    > I said that the book was being read by me.

    > **prōmīsī librum ā *mē lēctum īrī*.**  
    > I promised that the book would be read by me.

    > **scīuī librum ā *mē lēctum esse*.**  
    > I knew that the book had been read by me.

Note:

1. The reflexives *sē* and *suus, -a, -um* refers back to the subject of the verb which introduces the indirect statement(i.e. the subject of the main sentence, I think).

    > **Marcus scīuit *sē* *suum* librum eī dedisse.**  
    > Marcus knew that he (Marcus) had given his (Marcus') book to him/her (not Marcus anyways, someone else).

2. Those infinitives that include participles(і.e. future active and perfect passive) have to decline according to the subject thereof. Note that the very rare used future passive(supine + *īrī*) does not decline and the *fore ut* + subjunctive is used instead to express the same meaning.

    > **uxor mea dīcit sē Bāiās *aditūram* esse.**  
    > My wife says that she will go to Baiae.

    > **spērō fore ut dēleātur Carthāgō.**  
    > I hope that Carthage will be destroyed.

3. 'Say ... not' is *negō*, except when just a single word is negated.

    > **marītus *negāuit* sē Rōmae māsūrum esse.**  
    > The husband said that he would not stay at Rome.

    > **pater *dīxit* sē *nōn* mihi sed Marcō librum dedisse.**  
    > Father said that he had given the book not to me but to Marcus.

    Note the following:

    | Latin           | English                |
    |-----------------|------------------------|
    | negō quemquam   | I say that no one      |
    | negō quicquam   | I say that nothing     |
    | negō ūllum ...  | I say that no...       |
    | negō ... umquam | I say that ... never   |
    | negō ... usquam | I say that ... nowhere |

4. Verbs meaning 'hope', 'promise', and 'threaten' are followed by the accusative and (usually) future infinitive construction. But hopes and promises can refer to the present or the past, where the present or perfect infinitive is used.

    > **minātus est sē mē *necātūrum esse*.**  
    > He threatened to kill me. *Literally*: He threatened that he would kill me. (*minor, minārī, minātus sum* is a deponent verb btw)

    > **spērō Herculem leōnem *occīdisse*.**

5. Subordinate clauses in indirect statement have their verbs in the subjunctive, the tense to be determined by the [sequence of tenses](#sequence-of-tenses) established by the main verb.

    > **dīcit sē librum lēgisse quem sibi *dederim*.**  
    > He says that he has read the book which I gave him.

    > **iūrāuit sē librum lēctūrum esse quem *scrīpsissem*.**  
    > He swore tha he would read the book which I had written.

    > **mē certiōrem fēcit sē uenīre ad oppidum ubi *habitārem*.**  
    > He informed me that he was on his way to the town where І was living.

6. The main verb and the subject of multiple indirect statements' infinitives(as long as the same) need not to repeat.

    > **dīxit sē sine marītō Bāiās adiisse; inter plūrimōs lautissimōs quī sē eō congregāuissent iūcundē uīuere; in animō haēre diū in eō locō manēre.**  
    > She said that she had gone to Baiae without her husband; (she went on to say that she) was having a plesant time among the very many highly fashionable people who had gathered there; (she added that) she planned to stay in that place for a long time.

7. *sum* has two future infinitives: *futūrus esse* and *fore*.

8. *cōnstituō* (I decide) is followed by a present infinitive when the subject of the dependent verb is the same as teh subject of *constituō*.

    > **cōnstituī urbem relinquere.**  
    > I decided to leave the city.

9. The following verbs, though incomplete, should introduce indirect statement.

    | Latin                                               | English                    |

### Sequence of Tenses

There are two kinds of sequences of tenses: primary for present and future and historic for the past.

#### Primary sequence

Tense of verb in main clause:

- present
- imperative
- future
- perfect but conveying a sense of present
- future perfect

Tense of verb in suordinate clause:

- present: referring to the present or the future
- perfect: referring to the past

#### Historic sequence

Tense of verb in main clause:

- imperfect
- perfect but conveying a sense of simple past
- pluperfect

Tense of verb in suordinate clause:

- imperfect: referring to the same time or a later time
- pluperfect: referring to something that has already happened

### Direct and Indirect Command

#### Direct Command

##### Second Person Command

- Positive direct commands: imperative. and don't (as in 'do this *and don't* do that) = *neque/nec*.

  > **audī mē nec abī.**  
  > Listen to me and don't go away.

- Negative direct commands: *nōlī* (singular) / *nōlīte* (plural) + present infinitive. Or *nē* + present/perfect subjunctive. and don't =*neu/nēue* + present subjunctive.

  > **nōlīte spēluncās intrāre intrāre**  
  > Don't go into the caves.

  > **nē fēcerīs quod timēs.**  
  > Don't do something you're frightened of.

  > **illud nē fēcerīs nēue dīxerīs.**  
  > Do not do or say that.

Note:

In verse, nē can be followed by the imperative:

  > **nē fuge mē.**  
  > Don't run away from me.

##### First and Third Person Command

*nē* (if negative) + present subjunctive. and not = *neu/nēue*.

  > **amet.**  
  > Let him love.

  > **exear nēue plūra dīcat.**  
  > Let him go out and say no more.

  > **gaudeāmus.**  
  > Let us rejoice.

#### Indirect Command

*ut/nē* + present/imperfect subjunctive(depending on [sequence of tenses](#sequence-of-tenses)).

Two exceptions that are followed by an accusative and infinitive:

- *iubeо, iubēre, iussī, iussum*: I order
- *uetō, uetāre, uetuī, uetitum*: I order ... not, I forbid.

> **tibi imperō ut hoc faciās.**  
> I tell you to (literally, that you should) do this.

> **Vbiī Caesarem ōrant ui sibi parcat.**  
> The Ubii beg Caesar to(literall, that he should) spare them.

> **hoc nē faciās admoneō.**  
> I advise you not to do this.

> **mē iussit hoc facere.**  
> He ordered me to do this.

> **mē uetuit abīre.**  
> He forbade me to go away.

Note:

1. Not only the decisive and authoritative words like 'order/tell' use this construction, but also the less strong ones like 'advise/ask/beg/pray/encourage/warn/persuade'.

2. The reflexives *sē* and *suus* refer back to the subject of the verb which introduces the indirect command.

3. The following verbs should be learnt:

    | uetō, uetāre, uetuī, uetitum + infinitive                | I forbid, order not |

### Direct and Indirect Questions

#### Direct Questions

Latin has two ways of asking direct questions depending on whether an *question word* (e.g. who? when? why?, etc.) is used.. In both ways the verb is regularly in the indicative.

The *question verbs*:

 | Latin                          | English                                           |
 |--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
 | quis? quid?                    | who? what?                                        |
 | quī, quae, quod?               | whic? what? (adjective of above)                  |
 | quālis, quālis, quāle          | what sort of?                                     |
 | uter, utra, utrum?             | which (of two)?                                   |
 | quam?                          | how? (to what degree?) (with adjective or adverb) |
 | quōmodo? quemadmodum?          | how? (in what way?)                               |
 | quantus, quanta, quantum?      | how great?                                        |
 | quot? (indeclinable)           | how many?                                         |
 | quotīens? quotiēs?             | how often?                                        |
 | quamdiū?                       | how long? (of time)                               |
 | cūr? quārē? quam ob rem? quid? | why?                                              |
 | quandō?                        | when?                                             |
 | ubi? quā?                      | where?                                            |
 | quō?                           | where to? whither?                                |
 | unde?                          | from where? whence?                               |

> **quid dīcis?**  
> What are you saying?

> **quot līberōs habet rēgīna?**  
> How many children does the queen have?

> **quō uādis, domine?**  
> Where are you going to, master?

When no asking verb is present:

1. If its a yes/no question, there can be a *-ne* added to the first word. But when a question can be indicated by the sense or the context, the reinforcement of a *-ne* can be omitted.

2. If the questioner is expecting a 'yes', the question will begin with *nōnne*; if a 'no', *num*.

3. If there is a double question, you will probably find *utrum ... an* or *-ne ... an*. Negative *utrum ... annōn/necne*. You need not find a  translation for *utrum* in direct questions. It simply informs you that a second half to the question is coming up.

4. *an* can introduce a question containing the notion of surprise or indignation:

> **an nescīs quae sit haec rēs?**  
> Can you really be unaware what this business is about?

> **mēne fugis?**  
> Is it me you are running away from?

> **nōnne meministī?**  
> You do remember, don't you?

> **num huius oblīta es?**  
> Surely you haven't forgotten him/her/this?

> **seruīne estis an līberī?**  
> Are you slaves or free man?

> **utrum eum uīdistī annōn?**  
> Did you see him or not?

#### Indirect Questions

Basic formulation: **a verb** in which the voice, eyes, ears, or mind is used (e.g. ask, observe, hear, deduce) + **a question word** + **a subjunctive** whose tense corresponds to the English and [sequence of tenses](#sequence-of-tenses) is observed.

|tense\aspect|Primary|Historic|
|-|-|-|
|Present|**scit quid agam.** He knows what I am doing.|**scīuit quid agerem.** He knew what I was doing.|
|Past|**scit quid ēgerim** (perfect subjunctive)**.** He knows what I did.|**scīuit quid ēgissem** (pluperfect subjunctive)**.** He knew what I had done.|
|Future|**scit quid āctūrus sim.** He knows what I am going to do (shall do).|**scīuit quid āctūrus esssem.** He knew what I was going to do (would do).|

Note:

1. There is no future subjunctive in Latin and instead **a future participle** + **present/imperfect** (whatever the sequence calls for) **subjunctive form of *sum*** is used.

1. 'if', 'whether' = *num/an* (not *sī*), and after *num*, *quis,quid* is used for 'anyone', 'anything'.

2. *necne* (not *annōn*) is used to mean 'or not' in indirect questions.
