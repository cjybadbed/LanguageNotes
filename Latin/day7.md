### Indirect Statement

The subject of the clause in indirect speech is in the *accusative*, and it must not be left out. The verb is in the *infinitive* and is *in the tense of the words actually spoken or thought*. The infinitive exists in three tenses: present, future, perfect.

- Active:

    > dīxī *mē* librum *legere*.
    > I said I was reading the book.  
    > dīxī *mē* librum *lēctūrum esse*.
    > I said that I would read the book.  
    > dīxī *mē* librum *lēgisse*.
    > I said I had read the book.

- Passive:

    > dīxī librum ā *mē legī*.
    > I said that the book was being read by me.  
    > prōmīsī librum ā *mē lēctum īrī*.
    > I promised that the book would be read by me.  
    > scīuī librum ā *mē lēctum esse*.
    > I knew that the book had been read by me.

Note:

1. The reflexives *sē* and *suus, -a, -um* refers back to the subject of the verb which introduces the indirect statement(i.e. the subject of the main sentence, I think).

    > Marcus scīuit *sē* *suum* librum eī dedisse.  
    > Marcus knew that he (Marcus) had given his (Marcus') book to him/her (not Marcus anyways, someone else).

2. Those infinitives that include participles(і.e. future active and perfect passive) have to decline according to the subject thereof. Note that the very rare used future passive(supine + *īrī*) does not decline and the *fore ut* + subjunctive is used instead to express the same meaning.

    > uxor mea dīcit sē Bāiās *aditūram* esse.
    > My wife says that she will go to Baiae.  
    > spērō fore ut dēleātur Carthāgō.
    > I hope that Carthage will be destroyed.

3. 'Say ... not' is *negō*, except when just a single word is negated.

    > marītus *negāuit* sē Rōmae māsūrum esse.
    > The husband said that he would not stay at Rome.  
    > pater *dīxit* sē *nōn* mihi sed Marcō librum dedisse.
    > Father said that he had given the book not to me but to Marcus.

    Note the following:

     | Latin           | English                |
     |-----------------|------------------------|
     | negō quemquam   | I say that no one      |
     | negō quicquam   | I say that nothing     |
     | negō ūllum ...  | I say that no...       |
     | negō ... umquam | I say that ... never   |
     | negō ... usquam | I say that ... nowhere |

4. Verbs meaning 'hope', 'promise', and 'threaten' are followed by the accusative and (usually) future infinitive construction. But hopes and promises can refer to the present or the past, where the present or perfect infinitive is used.

    > minātus est sē mē *necātūrum esse*.
    > He threatened to kill me. *Literally*: He threatened that he would kill me. (*minor, minārī, minātus sum* is a deponent verb btw)  
    > spērō Herculem leōnem *occīdisse*.

5. Subordinate clauses in indirect statement have their verbs in the subjunctive, the tense to be determined by the [sequence of tenses](#sequence-of-tenses) established by the main verb.

    > dīcit sē librum lēgisse quem sibi *dederim*.
    > He says that he has read the book which I gave him.  
    > iūrāuit sē librum lēctūrum esse quem *scrīpsissem.
    > He swore tha he would read the book which I had written.  
    > mē certiōrem fēcit sē uenīre ad oppidum ubi *habitārem*.
    > He informed me that he was on his way to the town where І was living.

6. The main verb and the subject of multiple indirect statements' infinitives(as long as the same) need not to repeat.

    > dīxit sē sine marītō Bāiās adiisse; inter plūrimōs lautissimōs quī sē eō congregāuissent iūcundē uīuere; in animō haēre diū in eō locō manēre.  
    > She said that she had gone to Baiae without her husband; (she went on to say that she) was having a plesant time among the very many highly fashionable people who had gathered there; (she added that) she planned to stay in that place for a long time.

7. *sum* has two future infinitives: *futūrus esse* and *fore*.

8. *cōnstituō* (I decide) is followed by a present infinitive when the subject of the dependent verb is the same as teh subject of *constituō*.

    > cōnstituī urbem relinquere.  
    > I decided to leave the city.
