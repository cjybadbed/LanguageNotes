### Purpose Clauses

Purpose clauses are often called final clauses (from *fīnis*, end), referring to the end or purpose in view.

Basic formulation: *ut/nē* + present/imperfect subjunctive according to the sequence of tenses:

- **present/imperative/future/perfect-with-have** in main clause → **present** subjunctive
- **imperfect/perfect-without-have/pluperfect** in main clause → **imperfect** subjunctive

> **Rōmam accēdō ut prīncipem uidem.**  
> I am going to Rome to see the emperor/ so that I *may* see the emperor.

> **Rōmam adiī ut prīcipem uidērem.**  
> I went to Rome so that I *might* see the emperor/in order to see the emperor.

Note:

1. In English, 'may' and 'might' are often equivalents pf the Latin present and imperfect subjunctives respectively.

2. To use the infinitive to express purpose is not very common in classical Latin literature. *ut ... nōn* must never be used in this construction except when *nōn* negates a single word. Remember that the negative of *ut* is *ne*:

   > **Rōmā excessit nē Antōnium uidēret.**  
   > He left Rome in order not to see Antony.

   Note also:

   | Latin                 | English                                             |
   |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
   | nē quis, quis, quid   | in order that nobody ..., in case anybody ..., etc. |
   | nē ūllus, ūlla, ūllum | so that no ... (stronger than *nē quis*)            |
   | nē umquam, nēquandō   | so that ... never ...                               |
   | nē usquam, nēcubi     | so that ... nowhere ...                             |

3. *neu* or *nēue* (and not) introdcuces a second purpose clause if it is negative.

   > **Rōmā excessit nē Antōnium uidēret neu cōntiōnem audīret.**  
   > He left Rome in order to avoid seeing Antony and hearing his speech.

4. When the purpose clause contains a comparative adjective or an adverb, *quō* is used instead of *ut*:

   > **cucurrī quō celerius eо aduenīrem.**  
   > I ran so as to get there faster.

5. The relative pronoun (*quī, quae, quod*) is used with the subjunctive to express purpose and is regularly used in place of *ut* after verbs of giving, sending, and choosing, if the subject of the main clause is the same as the subject of the purpose clause.

   > **lēgātōs mīsit quī pācem peterent.**  
   > He sent ambassadors to seek peace (*literally*, who might seek ...).

6. *sē* or *suus* in a purpose clause is likely to refer back to the subject of the main clause:

   > **Rōmānī arma rapiunt quibus urbem suam dēfendant.**  
   > The Romans seize their arms in order to defend their city(*literally*, with which they may defend).

7. Note the following words and phrases which can occur in main clauses and serve as a king of signpost for a purpose clause:

   | Latin       | English                  |
   |-------------|--------------------------|
   | idcircō     | for this reason          |
   | ideō        | for this reason          |
   | eō          | for this/that purpose    |
   | proptereā   | on this account          |
   | eō cōnsiliō | with this/that intention |
   | eā causā    | for this/that reason     |
   | eā rē       | for this/that reason     |

   > **Cicerō eō cōnsiliō locūtus est ui Antōnium damnāret.**  
   > Cicero spoke with the intention of condemning Antony.

8. The first supine (ending *-um*) can be used to express purpose after verbs of motion and verbs implying motion:

   > **lēgātōs mīsit pācem petītum.**  
   > He sent ambassadors to seek peace.

   Note that *cubitum eō* = I go to bed: *cubitum is the supine of *cubō* (*cubō, cubāre, cubuī. cubitum*, I lie down, I lie asleep). Thus *cubitum eō* literally means 'I go to lie down'.


9. The use of the [future participles](../day6.html/#future-participles) and the [gerund and gerundive](TODO) to express purpose.

10. *utī* is a variant spelling of *ut* and must be distinguished from *ūtī*, the present infinitive of the verb *ūtor*.

### Result Clauses

Result clauses are also know as consecutive (i.e. consequence) clauses because the result clause follows on from (i.e. is a consequence of) the main clause.

Basic formulation: *ut/ut nōn* + subjunctive. The subjunctive is in the natural tense (i.e. the tense is dictated by the sense).

- The present subjunctive in historic sequence strsses the 'actuality' of the result: it is *now* true. Compare the folowing:

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut moriātur.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he is (now) dying.

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut morerētur.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he was dying.

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut mortuus sit.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he died/is dead.

  The perfect subjunctive streeses the completion of the result.

- If a future subjunctive is needed, the future participle plus *sim* or *essem* (present and imperfect of *sum*) is used.

  > **tam dīligenter labōrāmus ut crās in lectō mānsūrī simus.**  
  > We are working so hard that we shall stay in bed tomorrow.

Note:

1. This construction is very frequently signposted by one of the following words:

   | Latin                            | English                    |
   |----------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | tālis, tālis, tāle               | such, of such a kind       |
   | tantus, tanta, tantum            | so great, so large         |
   | tot (indeclinable)               | so many                    |
   | totiēns, totiēs                  | so often, so many times    |
   | tam (with adjectives or adverbs) | so ...                     |
   | adeō (with verbs)                | so much, to such an extent |
   | ita                              | so (in such a way)         |
   | sīc                              | so (in such a way)         |

   Note that *tālis* is not used with another adjective. The Latin for 'such a brave man' is *uir tam fortis*.

2. In result clauses the refelxives *sē* and *suus* refer to the subject of the *ut/ut nōn* clause. So in the following sentence, *eum* is used, not *sē*.

   > **tam fācundus erat Pompēius ut omnēs eum laudārent.**  
   > Pompeius was so eloquent that everyone used to praise him.

3. Remember that the negative of *ut* in this construction is *ut nōn* (not *nē*). When there is a second result clause and it is negative, Latin uses *nec* or *neque* (not *nēue*).

   > **tam clārē Mārcum de illīs rēbus certiōrem fēcit ut omnia intelegeret neque iam esset ignārus.**  
   > So clearly did he inform Marcus about these things that he understood everything and was no longer in ignorance.

   Note also:

   | Latin      | English          |
   |------------|------------------|
   | ut nēmō    | that nobody ...  |
   | ut nihil   | that nothing ... |
   | ut nūllus  | that no ...      |
   | ut numquam | that never ...   |
   | ut nusquam | that nowhere ... |

4. The relative with the subjunctive can be used to express result:

   > **nōn tam stulta est Līuia quae mendācibus crēdat.**  
   > Livia is not so tupid as to trust liars.

5. Note the idioms:

   - *sunt quī* + subjunctive: there are some people who ...
   - *is sum quī* + subjunctive: I am the type of person who ...

   > **sunt quī Graecōs meliōrēs quam Rōmānōs habeant.**  
   > There are people who consider Greeks superior to Romans.

   > **ea est quae pauperēs semper cūret.**  
   > She is the sort of woman who is always llooking after the poor.

   We call this use of the subjunctive generic(from Latin *genus*, type, kind) because it is used to convey the result of people being the 'types' they are.

6. *quam quī* or *quam ut* is used after a comparative in such sentences as:

   > **fortior est quam quī (ut) effugiat.**  
   > He is toobrave to run away.  
   > *Literally*, He is braver than the sort of man who runs away *or* He is too brave for the result to be that he runs away.

7. Note *dignus/indignus sum quī* + subjunctive = I am worthy/unworthy to ..., I deserve to ..., I do not deserve to ...:

   > **digna est quae morte pūniātur.**  
   > She deserves to be punished by death.  
   > *Literally*, She is worthy so that (as a result) she should be punished by death.
