### Purpose Clauses

Purpose clauses are often called final clauses (from *fīnis*, end), referring to the end or purpose in view.

Basic formulation: *ut/nē* + present/imperfect subjunctive according to the sequence of tenses:

- **present/imperative/future/perfect-with-have** in main clause → **present** subjunctive
- **imperfect/perfect-without-have/pluperfect** in main clause → **imperfect** subjunctive

> **Rōmam accēdō ut prīncipem uidem.**  
> I am going to Rome to see the emperor/ so that I *may* see the emperor.

> **Rōmam adiī ut prīcipem uidērem.**  
> I went to Rome so that I *might* see the emperor/in order to see the emperor.

Note:

1. In English, 'may' and 'might' are often equivalents pf the Latin present and imperfect subjunctives respectively.

2. To use the infinitive to express purpose is not very common in classical Latin literature. *ut ... nōn* must never be used in this construction except when *nōn* negates a single word. Remember that the negative of *ut* is *ne*:

   > **Rōmā excessit nē Antōnium uidēret.**  
   > He left Rome in order not to see Antony.

   Note also:

   | Latin                 | English                                             |
   |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
   | nē quis, quis, quid   | in order that nobody ..., in case anybody ..., etc. |
   | nē ūllus, ūlla, ūllum | so that no ... (stronger than *nē quis*)            |
   | nē umquam, nēquandō   | so that ... never ...                               |
   | nē usquam, nēcubi     | so that ... nowhere ...                             |

3. *neu* or *nēue* (and not) introdcuces a second purpose clause if it is negative.

   > **Rōmā excessit nē Antōnium uidēret neu cōntiōnem audīret.**  
   > He left Rome in order to avoid seeing Antony and hearing his speech.

4. When the purpose clause contains a comparative adjective or an adverb, *quō* is used instead of *ut*:

   > **cucurrī quō celerius eо aduenīrem.**  
   > I ran so as to get there faster.

5. The relative pronoun (*quī, quae, quod*) is used with the subjunctive to express purpose and is regularly used in place of *ut* after verbs of giving, sending, and choosing, if the subject of the main clause is the same as the subject of the purpose clause.

   > **lēgātōs mīsit quī pācem peterent.**  
   > He sent ambassadors to seek peace (*literally*, who might seek ...).

6. *sē* or *suus* in a purpose clause is likely to refer back to the subject of the main clause:

   > **Rōmānī arma rapiunt quibus urbem suam dēfendant.**  
   > The Romans seize their arms in order to defend their city(*literally*, with which they may defend).

7. Note the following words and phrases which can occur in main clauses and serve as a king of signpost for a purpose clause:

   | Latin       | English                  |
   |-------------|--------------------------|
   | idcircō     | for this reason          |
   | ideō        | for this reason          |
   | eō          | for this/that purpose    |
   | proptereā   | on this account          |
   | eō cōnsiliō | with this/that intention |
   | eā causā    | for this/that reason     |
   | eā rē       | for this/that reason     |

   > **Cicerō eō cōnsiliō locūtus est ui Antōnium damnāret.**  
   > Cicero spoke with the intention of condemning Antony.

8. The first supine (ending *-um*) can be used to express purpose after verbs of motion and verbs implying motion:

   > **lēgātōs mīsit pācem petītum.**  
   > He sent ambassadors to seek peace.

   Note that *cubitum eō* = I go to bed: *cubitum is the supine of *cubō* (*cubō, cubāre, cubuī. cubitum*, I lie down, I lie asleep). Thus *cubitum eō* literally means 'I go to lie down'.


9. The use of the [future participles](../day6.html/#future-participles) and the [gerund and gerundive](TODO) to express purpose.

10. *utī* is a variant spelling of *ut* and must be distinguished from *ūtī*, the present infinitive of the verb *ūtor*.

### Result Clauses

Result clauses are also know as consecutive (i.e. consequence) clauses because the result clause follows on from (i.e. is a consequence of) the main clause.

Basic formulation: *ut/ut nōn* + subjunctive. The subjunctive is in the natural tense (i.e. the tense is dictated by the sense).

- The present subjunctive in historic sequence strsses the 'actuality' of the result: it is *now* true. Compare the folowing:

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut moriātur.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he is (now) dying.

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut morerētur.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he was dying.

  > **tot uulnera accēpit ut mortuus sit.**  
  > He received so many wounds that he died/is dead.

  The perfect subjunctive streeses the completion of the result.

- If a future subjunctive is needed, the future participle plus *sim* or *essem* (present and imperfect of *sum*) is used.

  > **tam dīligenter labōrāmus ut crās in lectō mānsūrī simus.**  
  > We are working so hard that we shall stay in bed tomorrow.

Note:

1. This construction is very frequently signposted by one of the following words:

   | Latin                            | English                    |
   |----------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | tālis, tālis, tāle               | such, of such a kind       |
   | tantus, tanta, tantum            | so great, so large         |
   | tot (indeclinable)               | so many                    |
   | totiēns, totiēs                  | so often, so many times    |
   | tam (with adjectives or adverbs) | so ...                     |
   | adeō (with verbs)                | so much, to such an extent |
   | ita                              | so (in such a way)         |
   | sīc                              | so (in such a way)         |

   Note that *tālis* is not used with another adjective. The Latin for 'such a brave man' is *uir tam fortis*.

2. In result clauses the refelxives *sē* and *suus* refer to the subject of the *ut/ut nōn* clause. So in the following sentence, *eum* is used, not *sē*.

   > **tam fācundus erat Pompēius ut omnēs eum laudārent.**  
   > Pompeius was so eloquent that everyone used to praise him.

3. Remember that the negative of *ut* in this construction is *ut nōn* (not *nē*). When there is a second result clause and it is negative, Latin uses *nec* or *neque* (not *nēue*).

   > **tam clārē Mārcum de illīs rēbus certiōrem fēcit ut omnia intelegeret neque iam esset ignārus.**  
   > So clearly did he inform Marcus about these things that he understood everything and was no longer in ignorance.

   Note also:

   | Latin      | English          |
   |------------|------------------|
   | ut nēmō    | that nobody ...  |
   | ut nihil   | that nothing ... |
   | ut nūllus  | that no ...      |
   | ut numquam | that never ...   |
   | ut nusquam | that nowhere ... |

4. The relative with the subjunctive can be used to express result:

   > **nōn tam stulta est Līuia quae mendācibus crēdat.**  
   > Livia is not so tupid as to trust liars.

5. Note the idioms:

   - *sunt quī* + subjunctive: there are some people who ...
   - *is sum quī* + subjunctive: I am the type of person who ...

   > **sunt quī Graecōs meliōrēs quam Rōmānōs habeant.**  
   > There are people who consider Greeks superior to Romans.

   > **ea est quae pauperēs semper cūret.**  
   > She is the sort of woman who is always llooking after the poor.

   We call this use of the subjunctive generic(from Latin *genus*, type, kind) because it is used to convey the result of people being the 'types' they are.

6. *quam quī* or *quam ut* is used after a comparative in such sentences as:

   > **fortior est quam quī (ut) effugiat.**  
   > He is toobrave to run away.  
   > *Literally*, He is braver than the sort of man who runs away *or* He is too brave for the result to be that he runs away.

7. Note *dignus/indignus sum quī* + subjunctive = I am worthy/unworthy to ..., I deserve to ..., I do not deserve to ...:

   > **digna est quae morte pūniātur.**  
   > She deserves to be punished by death.  
   > *Literally*, She is worthy so that (as a result) she should be punished by death.

### Verbs of Fearing

Where English uses an infinitive so does Latin, whereas if there's a 'that', Latin uses *nē* + subjunctive, tense determined by sequence of tenses.

> **timeō hoc facere.**  
> I am afraid to do this.

> **timō nē mē prōdiderīs.**   
> I am afraid (lest/that) you have betrayed me.

Note that the present subjunctive can refer to the future in primary sequence and the imperfect subjunctive in historic. The future participle + *sim/essem* is generally NOT used after verbs of fearing.

> **uereor nē illa me uideat.**  
> I am fraid that she will see me.

> **metuēbam nē illa mē uidēret.**  
> I was afraid that she would see me.

The negative of *nē* is *nē ... nōn* (or *nē* + *nemo/nihil/numquam/...*) or *ut* but not when the main verb is negated.

> **timuī nē mihi auxilium nōn ferrēs.**  
> I was frightened that you would not bring me help.

> **timeō ut veniat.**  
> I fear that he may not come.

*sē* or *suus* in the fearing clause refers back to the subject of the main verb.

> **Cicerō timuit nē fūrēs mēsam suam pretiōsam abriperent.**  
> Cicero was afraid that thieves might steal his valuable table.

Note these words:

| Latin                          | English                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| timeō (2)                      | I fear, I am afraid        |
| metuō, metuere, metuī, metūtum | I fear, I am afraid        |
| paueō, pauēre, pāuī, -         | I am frightened, terrified |
| uereor (2)                     | I fear, I am afraid        |
| ueritus, uerita, ueritum       | fearing                    |
| timor, timōris, *m.*           | fear                       |
| metus, metūs, *m.*             | fear                       |
| perīculum, perīculī, *n.*      | danger                     |

### Impersonal Verbs

A verb used only in the infinitive or in the third person. In the third person, the subject is either implied or a dummy.

#### Active Usage

1. Weather verbs:

   | Latin         | English                       |
   |---------------|-------------------------------|
   | tonat         | it thunders                   |
   | ningit        | it snows                      |
   | pluit         | it rains                      |
   | aduesperāscit | it is drawing towards evening |

2. Impersonal verb + *dative* of the person + infinitive:

   > **dīcere mihi libet.**  
   > It pleases me to speak.

   > **dīcere mihi licet.**  
   > It is allowed to me to speak, i.e. I may speak.

   > **dīcere mihi placet.**  
   > It pleases me to speak, I like speaking, I decide to speak.

   > **dīcere mihi uidētur.**  
   > It seems a good ides to me to speak, I decide to speak.

   Note that all these verbs are in the 2nd conjugation.

3. Impersonal verb + *accusative* of the person + infinitive:

   > **dīcere mē decet.**  
   > It is fitting for me to speak.

   > **dīcere mē oportuit.**  
   > It behoved me to speak.

   > **dīcere mē iuuat.**  
   > It pleases me to speak, I like speaking.

   *decet* and *oportet* are 2nd conjugation, *iuuat* is 1st.

4. Impersonal verbs of feeling: the person who feels is in the *accusative*, the cause of the feeling is in the *genitive*:

   > **mē miseret rēgīnae.**  
   > I am sorry for (I pity) the queen.

   > **mē paenitet dictōrum.**  
   > I am sorry for (I repent) my words.

   > **mē piget studiōrum.**  
   > I am repelled by my studies. (in old fashioned English, it irks ...)

   > **mē pudēbat factōrum.**  
   > I was ashamed of my deeds.

   > **mē taedet grammaticae.**  
   > I am tired of grammar. (cf. it wearies me)

   Note that all these verbs are 2nd conjugation and they an be used with infinitive:

   > **mē paenituit tot mala dē tē dīxisse.**  
   > I was sorry to have said so many bad things about you.

   > **puellās lūdere pudet.**  
   > The girls are ashamed to play.

Note: 

1. For the two rods *interest* and *rēfert*, if the concerned is someone expressed with a pronoun, it is in the *feminine ablative*:

   > **meā (tuā, suā, nostrā, uestrā) interest.**  
   > it is important to me (you, him, her, us, you)

   > **meā (tuā, suā, nostrā, uestrā) rēfert.**  
   > it concerns me (you, him, her us, you)

   In other cases the person or thing concerned is in the genitive:

   > **interest patris**  
   > it is important to the father

2. *necesse est* + infinitive/subjunctive = it is necessary.

3. *accidit ut* + subjunctive = it happens that. singular 

#### Passive Usage

In Latin, if a verb is used transitively (o.e. with an accusative object), it can be put in the passive by making what was the accusative object the new nominative subject:

> **rēgem interfēcī.**  
> I killed the king.

> **rēx ā mē interfectus est.**  
> The king as killed by me.

Otherwise it can only be used impersonally in the passive and the subject becomes *it*, the third person singular neuter.

> **acriter pugnāvērunt.**  
> They fought fiercely.

> **acriter pugnātum est.**  
> It was fought fiercely. (There was fierce fighting)

This kind of usage is especially common with verbs of motion:

> prīmā lūce profectī sumus. merīdiē ad lacum peruentum est.  
> We set out at dawn. At midday we came (literally, it was come) to the lake.

> undique concurritur.  
> People run together from every direction. literally, It is run together from every direction.

> sīc ītur ad astra.  
> That (i.e. fame) is the way to the stars. Literally, Thus it is gone to the stars.

Verbs followed by the dative can only be used impersonally as well, for it is impossible to make the dative object of the active verb the nominative subject of the passive verb. The dative remains dative.

> **lēgibus pārēmus.** (active)  
> We obey the laws.

> **lēgibus ā nōbīs pārētur.**  
> The laws are obeyed by us. Literally, THere is obeying/obedience to the laws by us.

> **captīuīs parcētur.**  
> The prisoners will be spared. Literally, THere will be sparing to the prisoners.

> **cōnsulī ā nūllō crēditur.**  
> The consul is trusted by nobody.
